When a Tkinter program runs, it runs a mainloop (an infinite loop)
which is responsible for running a GUI program. 
At a time only one instance of mainloop can be active,
so in order to open a new window we have to use a widget,
"Toplevel".

A Toplevel widget works pretty much like a Frame,
but it opens in a separate top-level window,
such windows have all the properties that a main window (root/master window) should have.
